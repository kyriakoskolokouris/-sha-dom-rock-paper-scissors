This is an updated version of the Rock Paper Scissors game created the previous month.
I have added some HTML, CSS. 
Furthermore, I have  modified somehow the JavaScript code, adding some new learned techniques with DOM manipulation, addEventListeners and the forEAch() method. 
I will put it on netlify soon.
